# Recursion-Search-Files
In the project, I created a Java application that allows searching for files and renames files in batches. There are two interfaces: searching files and renaming files. 
Rename files features: The "rename template" text box allows the user to rename all the files in sequential order in the selected folder. There is an option to relocate the renamed files into a different folder. There is another option to include or exclude subfolders.
